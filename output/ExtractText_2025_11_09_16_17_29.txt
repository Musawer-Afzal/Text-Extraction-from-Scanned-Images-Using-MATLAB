The Honorable Orrin G. Hatch United States States Chairman, Congress of the Assembly United States Senate Washington, DC 20510-6275 Dear Senator Hatch:
I am enclosing answers to the questions of Senators Kennedy and Kohl you you forwarded on July 2, 1997. The answers have been prepared as responses by all at the companies that are parties to the settlement, and they reflect a joint industry response rather than the response of only one tompany or a personal response by me. Each of the cigarette manufacturers has determined to respond to senator Kennedy's questions individually and individual tompany responses to those questions will be submitted separately or shortly to yes and to Senator Kennedy.
I personally regret the delay that has been sntolled in responding to these questions. I would have hoped that responses could have been completed earlier than now. The attention that Members of the Committee have paid to this matter is deeply appreciated. I hope that the completeness of the responses has not excessively complicated the work of the Committee.
cerely,
Matthew Meyer . - - \
