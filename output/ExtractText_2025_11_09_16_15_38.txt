The Honorable Orrin G. Hatch United States States Chairman, Congress of the Assembly United States Senate Washington, DC 20510-6275 Dear Senator Hatch:

I am enclosing answers to the questions of Senators Kennedy and Kohl you you forwarded on July 2, 1997. The answers have been prepared as responses by all at the tompanies that are parties to the settlement, and they reflect a joint industry response rather than the response of only one tompany or a personal response by me. Each of she cigarette manufacturers has determined to respond to senator Kennedy's questions individually and individual tompany responses to chose questions will be ssuvares separately or tonsrrou to yes and to senntor Kennedy.

I personally regret the delay that has been sntolled in responding to thess questions. I would have hoped that responses tould have been completed earlier than now. The attention that Members of the Committee have paid to this matter is deeply appreciated. I hope that the toramess of she responses has not eIcessively complicated the work of she Committee.
