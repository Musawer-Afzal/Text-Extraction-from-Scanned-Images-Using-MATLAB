The Eenmrable Orrin G. Hatch lrnlta-1 states EanituI Chairman, toumctos on she ausselssy United states Senate Washington, n.::. 1D51u—6275 Dear senator Hatch: I am enclosing answers to the questions of Senators Kennedy and Kohl chs: yuu forwarded In an on July 2:, 1997. The answers have been prepared as responses by all at the canrpanles that are parties to the settlement, than they reflect s joint industry response rather than she response of only one tompshy or s pertonal response by me. Each at she cigarette manufacturers has determined to respond to senator Kennedy's quasizion individually and individual tompany responses to those questions will be ssuvares separately or tonsrrou to yes and to senntor Kennedy. I pertonally regret the delay that has been sntolled in responding to these questions. I would have hoped that responses tould have been completed earlier than now. The attention that Members of (ha Committee have paid to this matter is deeply appreciated. I hope she: the toramess of she responses has no: eIcessively complicated the work of she Committee. //* /.7 // T maI/tv /// Meyer . Inpleu S111 - - \ ‘ plow
